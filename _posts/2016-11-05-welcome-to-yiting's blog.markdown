The birth of this blog should be credit to one of my friends who suggested me to write one in Sept. At that time, I said to her: "But my English is very poor." She answered: "Then you can write in Chinese."

Obviously, I ended up with English. There is still chance that I will include Chinese versions in the further. It would be more than appreciated if anyone reading my post could give me suggestions on English writing. 

This blog will most likely be a technical blog, which records what I learn step by step as a programmer. It is intended to be a source of references and a platform for discussions. 

Since I am still learning myself, what I post may not be correct. If you find that I said something wrong, please don't hesitate to notify me through comments or email. Many thanks in advance.
